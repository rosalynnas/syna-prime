SYNA is an app that enables users to take notes in a nonlinear fashion that is illustrative of how humans process information.

## SYNA

SYNA is short for "synapse". Synapse derives from the Greek word for synapsis (συνάψις) and conjunction (συνάπτεὶν), which is a compound of to fasten (ἅπτειν) and together (συν).

Neurons are cells that are specialized to pass signals to individual target cells, and synapses are the means by which they do so. They can be seen as representing the union between two seperate elements.

SYNA′ (pronounced SYNA prime) is a derivation of the core app which demonstrates the technology with topics in calculus.
